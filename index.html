          <h3>The web in the future</h3>
          <p>
            To be able to say where we think the internet will take us in 5 years or more, we must start from where we are right now. As it is right now, people are using their phones for connectivity and interaction with the internet more than people are using laptops and PCs. People even surf the internet on their gaming consoles, just out of pure laziness. We have smart watches that are connected to our phones via BlueTooth and we stream videos from our phones to our TVs. 
          </p>
          <p>  
            So, where could we possibly go from here? Personally, I think that the future will depend on wether or not governments try to restrict us, or make it even more open to us. We will most likely be able to connect our whole identities to our phones or smart watches, like our bank details or passports, paying for petrol without leaving your car to get our credit card out. Maybe even just scanning your phone against a sensor in the petrol pump. Or when your car needs to fill up with petrol, your phone will automatically give your a GPS route to the nearest and cheapest petrol station. We will also most likely be able to connect to our physical items, such as the coffee maker - being able to watch a timer on when the coffee is ready. Check our fuel level in our cars, connect to the stove or the microwave or the refrigerator.
          </p>         
          <p>
            To assume where we will be in the future with the internet, we must proceed thinking like the laziest man/woman on earth. What can we do to really minimize our physical efforts in real life? This will not necessarily mean just the internet, but also the technical advancement in our phones and such. A quick example of that could be, an updated version of IR or BlueTooth in your phone, to be able to just point your phone at any screen that you've connected your phone to, and just quickly turn the screen off or on with the click of a button. I even think that companies will advance to minimize office space, and take care of almost everything online. Connect to their work database from home, or where ever they are. This would result in internet connectivity where ever you are in the world. Working from the rain forest in the Amazon? No problem, you've got 100gb down and upload.
          </p>
          <p>
            So in short, I think the future will just mean severely updated versions of the functions we currently have on our phones. I think more items will have BlueTooth connectivity, I think that more physical items in our houses will be more and more like smart phones, and the future itself, will be even more centered around our phones and the concept of connectivity.
