        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>
          Well, I am a 23 year old guy from Helsingborg, Sweden - (although I was born in <strong>Västerås</strong>). At heart, I am a drummer. I've played drums all my life, and that's really my one true passion. Last year I started studying in Malmö, Sweden - at "Teknikhögskolan" to become a web developer. About a month ago I quit there to attend this distance learning course - provided by Lernia and the good fellas from Zocom. I quit "Teknikhögskolan" because within 2 terms we had lost 120+ hours in lesson time. All because the teachers were consults for other companies and didn't focus on their teaching to 100%.

          My bands at the moment are: <strong>Mörbultad - hardcore band</strong> from Helsingborg. We are very active all over Sweden and have released 3 albums so far, with our fourth album coming this fall. My second band <strong>Chronus - progressive metal</strong> also from Helsingborg, Sweden. I recently joined this band under tragic circumstances - their drummer died in a traffic accident at 19 years old in the beginning of 2015.

          Myself and Chronus have a very close relationship with the band Soilwork, also from Helsingborg, Sweden. Chronus guitarist "Svante Furevi" recently played 2 festival gigs with them, as a stand in for their guitarist David who couldn't attend. Soilwork recently mentioned us in a live stream they had, promoting their 10th studio album: THE RIDE MAJESTIC. <a href="https://youtu.be/iKBOVkoHRd0">Video of Soilwork mentioning us</a>

        <h4>What could I teach out to someone else?</h4>
        <p>
          I have been a drum teacher for 3 years, teaching children from 6 years up to elders at age 60+. It's never too late to start with and instrument, heart really goes a long way if you want to learn something. A fun exemple is a lady age 43 told me she hadn't pursued drumming because she was afraid of "sheet music"/"drum notes". I immediately wrote down some drum notes and showed them to her. At first she didn't understand a single thing, but I told her that "Within five minutes you can play anything that I write down". She did not believe me at all, so I just gave her my drum notes. I casually explained what they meant, and just like that, she played what I had written down just 2 minutes after being shown it for the first time in her life.
