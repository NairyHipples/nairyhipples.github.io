        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>Well, I am a 23 year old guy from <strong>Helsingborg, Sweden</strong> - (although I was born in <strong>Västerås</strong>). At heart, I am a drummer. I've played drums all my life, and that's really my one true passion. Last year I started studying in Malmö, Sweden - at "Teknikhögskolan" to become a web developer. About a month ago I quit there to attend this distance learning course - provided by Lernia and the good fellas from Zocom. I quit "Teknikhögskolan" because within 2 terms we had lost 120+ hours in lesson time. All because the the ministrator didn't plan enough lessons in the education plan, which had a studying tempo of 100%.</p>
        <p>My bands at the moment are: <strong>Mörbultad - hardcore band</strong> from Helsingborg. We are very active all over Sweden and have released 3 albums so far, with our fourth album coming <strong>this February</strong>. Our biggest show being support to Phil Anselmo from Pantera in 2014.</p>

        <h4>What could I teach out to someone else?</h4>
        <p>I have been a drum teacher for 3 years, teaching children from 6 years up to elders at age 60+. It's never too late to start with and instrument (or basically anything), heart really goes a long way if you want to learn something. A fun exemple is a lady age 43 told me she hadn't pursued drumming because she was afraid of "sheet music"/"drum notes". I immediately wrote down some drum notes and showed them to her. At first she didn't understand a single thing, but I told her that "Within five minutes you can play anything that I write down". She did not believe me at all, so I just gave her my drum notes. I casually explained what they meant, and just like that, she played what I had written down just 2 minutes after being shown it for the first time in her life.</p>

        <h4>Other fun facts?</h4>
        <p>Yes. I am a very active gamer. I used to play PC games only, but I got myself a PlayStation 4 about a year ago with the game Destiny. I played it a lot, and got to know my best friends in the whole world who live in Newcastle, England. This year for my birthday, I went to see them for the first time in real life. Guess what I packed? A few clothes, and my PlayStation. We planned my visit around Destiny's seond expansion House of Wolves, so we sat at their house, playing from dusk til dawn like we used to, only this time we did it in real life istead. Pretty crazy, but it was such great fun. We of course went into Newcastle and got hammered and watched Newcastle United play their last game of the Premier League season too, but the best part was seeing my best friends in real life for the first time.</p>
